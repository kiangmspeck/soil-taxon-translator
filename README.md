# soil-taxon-translator
The purpose of this script is to read a soil taxonomic name at the subgroup level and translate that name into the respective order, suborder, great group, and subgroup.

Soil taxonomic names often sounds like gibberish to anyone outside of the soil science field. This is due to the fact that the formative elements of the taxonomic names are derived from multiple languages or are completely made up. However, fully understanding the name of a soil gives several clues as to its origin and characteristics. Therefore, it is important for anyone with an interest in soils to be able to dissect a soil name and understand its formative elements. Hopefully, this program can assist in such endeavors.

How to Run: 
This script was written in Python 3, and therefore requires Python 3 be downloaded on your machine before running. Python can be downloaded at https://www.python.org/downloads/ .

This script can be run in any computer by navigating to the folder containing the script (must end in the '.py' extensions) and entering python3 <script_name.py>.

Navigating to the correct folder can by done by using the command 'cd <\Users\your\folder>'.

No libraries are required for this script.

How to Use:
This script only takes one user input- a soil taxonomic name at the subgroup level i.e 'vitrandic haploxerolls'. The program will then translate the given name into order, suborder, great group, and subgroup for any soil listed in the twelfth edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). It is important the user inputs the taxa in its plural form, like one would find on an Official Soil Description (OSD). For example, enter 'vitrandic haploxerolls' and not 'vitrandic haploxeroll'. The exception to this is any soil taxonomic name that ends in 'ox'. 

Future Directions:
This program will be updated alongside any updates to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, but those updates may take some time. If entering any new soil names from the thirteenth edition, this program may not function properly.
There may be further expansions of this program to accept soil names to the family level.
